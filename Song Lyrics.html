<title>Song Lyrics</title>

<h1>Safe</b><br></h1>
<h2 >By: Victory Worship</h2>

<p>[Verse 1]<br>
Under Your grace, Your mercy amazes me<br>
Under Your wings, Your shadow covers me<br>
Your promise of love, where my heart is safely undone</p><br>

<p >[Verse 2]<br>
Speak to me Lord, Your servant is listening<br>
Over the noise, I hear You whispering<br>
My hope has come and my heart is safely undone</p><br>

<p >[Chorus]<br>
I found my fortress, in You<br>
And my soul is anchored, with You<br>
My resting place, is in Your name<br>
Forever safe</p><br>

<p >[Verse 2]<br>
Speak to me Lord, Your servant is listening<br>
Over the noise, I hear You whispering<br>
My hope has come and my heart is safely undone</p><br>

<p >[Chorus]<br>
I found my fortress, in You<br>
And my soul is anchored, with You<br>
My resting place, is in Your name<br>
I found my fortress, in You<br>
And my soul is anchored, with You<br>
My resting place, is in Your name</p><br>

<p >[Post-Chorus]<br>
Forever safe, forever safe<br>
Forever safe, forever safe</p><br>

<p >[Bridge]<br>
You are never far away<br>
Always reaching out to save<br>
My weakness covered by Your strength<br>
And I am found forever safe<br>
You are never far away<br>
Always reaching out to save<br>
My weakness covered by Your strength<br>
And I am found forever safe</p><br>

<p>[Chorus]<br>
I found my fortress, in You<br>
And my soul is anchored, with You<br>
My resting place, is in Your name<br>
Forever safe<br>
I found my fortress, in You<br>
And my soul is anchored, with You<br>
My resting place, is in Your name<br>
I found my fortress, in You<br>
And my soul is anchored, with You<br>
My resting place, is in Your name<br>
Forever safe</p><br>
