        <p>Hi again and welcome to my initial Website! Again I'm Danica Mae B. Evangelista, a 3rd year student of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. And now I'm a part of Student Council Committee. I'm the Deputy officer of Student Affairs and Welfare. Also I'm part of PUP Opencell, a religious group that encouraging students in PUP to be part and to know God more. I really love playing Volleyball, watching K-drama, sharing the Gospel and listening to worship songs. I hate those people who is plastic, because I'm such a person that is straightforward and don't like sugar-coated words.</p>
